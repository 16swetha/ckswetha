**WE NEED TO USE RISCV CODE VERILOG NETLIST AND TESTBENCH FOR FUNCTIONAL STIMULATION** AS PER THE TASK

THE WAVEFORMS ARE GENERATED USING GTKWAVE WHILE THE VERILOG CODE BEING EXECUTED.

**1. RISC-V RV321**
 A 32-bit RISC-V core that adheres to the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectural concept is called the RISC-V RV32I.</p>
 Overview of Architecture: An open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that outlines the functionality of computer processor cores is called RISC-V. It prioritizes efficiency and simplicity with the goal of offering a versatile and usable design for a range of applications.</p>
